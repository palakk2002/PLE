• warranty information;
• quotation validity period; and
• any special commercial conditions.
Unless expressly stated otherwise, a quotation is an invitation to negotiate and does not constitute a legally binding offer capable of acceptance by the Business Customer.

B. Quotation Validity
Each quotation shall remain valid only for the period expressly specified in the quotation. Where no validity period is specified, the Company reserves the right to withdraw, modify, or revise the quotation at any time before acceptance of the corresponding Purchase Order. Upon expiry of the quotation validity period, pricing and commercial terms may be revised without prior notice.

C. Pricing
Product and Service pricing may be determined based on factors including:
• Manufacturer pricing;
• Supplier pricing;
• Distributor pricing;
• market conditions;
• exchange rate fluctuations;
• Product availability;
• order quantities;
• procurement costs;
• freight and logistics costs;
• insurance costs;
• applicable Taxes;
• negotiated commercial arrangements; and
• any other relevant commercial considerations.
Pricing may vary between Business Customers based on negotiated agreements or approved commercial programs.

D. Taxes and Government Charges
Unless expressly stated otherwise in writing:
• all prices are exclusive of applicable Taxes;
• Goods and Services Tax (GST) shall be charged at the applicable statutory rate;
• customs duties, import duties, levies, cess, withholding taxes, or similar governmental charges shall be borne by the party responsible under applicable law or the relevant commercial agreement; and
• the Business Customer shall provide any documentation reasonably required for tax compliance.
The Company shall issue invoices in accordance with applicable taxation laws.

E. Freight, Insurance and Additional Charges
Unless expressly included within the quotation, pricing may exclude:
• shipping charges;
• freight charges;
• insurance;
• packaging charges;
• installation costs;
• commissioning services;
• unloading charges;
• customs clearance expenses;
• storage charges;
• handling fees; and
• any other ancillary charges.
Such charges shall be separately communicated or reflected in the applicable quotation, Purchase Order, invoice, or Contract.

F. Pricing Errors
Despite reasonable efforts, pricing errors, typographical mistakes, calculation errors, technical issues, or system malfunctions may occasionally occur. If the Company discovers a genuine pricing error before accepting a Purchase Order, it may:
• correct the pricing;
• issue a revised quotation;
• request confirmation from the Business Customer; or
• decline the Order without liability.
Where an Order has already been accepted, the Company shall work with the Business Customer in good faith to resolve the issue in accordance with applicable law and any executed Contract.

G. Price Revisions
The Company reserves the right to revise Product or Service pricing before acceptance of a Purchase Order due to:
• Manufacturer price revisions;
• Supplier cost changes;
• changes in Taxes;
• regulatory changes;
• exchange rate fluctuations;
• freight or logistics cost increases;
• changes in Product availability;
• discontinuation of Products; or
• other commercially reasonable circumstances beyond the Company's control.
No price revision shall affect an accepted Purchase Order unless expressly permitted under the applicable Contract or required by law.

H. Discounts and Promotional Pricing
The Company may, at its sole discretion, offer:
• volume discounts;
• negotiated commercial pricing;
• promotional pricing;
• project-specific pricing;
• tender pricing;
• institutional pricing;
• reseller pricing;
• channel partner pricing; or
• other commercial incentives.
Unless expressly agreed in writing:
• discounts shall not be cumulative;
• promotional pricing shall remain subject to availability;
• discounts shall not create an ongoing entitlement for future Orders; and
• promotional programs may be modified or withdrawn without prior notice.

I. Currency
Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all quotations, invoices, Purchase Orders, and commercial transactions shall be denominated in the currency specified by the Company. Where foreign currency transactions are agreed, pricing may be adjusted to reflect:
• exchange rate movements;
• banking charges;
• import costs;
• regulatory requirements; and
• other agreed commercial terms.

J. Custom Quotations
For project-based procurement, enterprise deployments, government tenders, institutional procurements, or other specialized commercial transactions, the Company may issue customized quotations containing additional commercial terms, including:
• milestone-based pricing;
• phased deliveries;
• project implementation schedules;
• customized warranty terms;
• service-level commitments;
• installation services;
• support arrangements; and
• other mutually agreed commercial conditions.
In the event of any inconsistency, the mutually executed written agreement or accepted quotation shall prevail over this Chapter to the extent of the inconsistency.

K. Non-Binding Estimates
Any indicative pricing, budgetary estimates, preliminary quotations, catalog prices, or verbal pricing information provided by the Company are for informational purposes only and do not constitute binding commercial commitments. Only a written quotation or other commercial document issued by the Company and accepted in accordance with these Terms shall form the basis of a commercial transaction.

L. Business Customer Responsibilities
The Business Customer shall:
• review quotations carefully before placing a Purchase Order;
• verify Product specifications and quantities;
• notify the Company of any discrepancies without undue delay;
• ensure that Purchase Orders accurately reflect the agreed commercial terms; and
• obtain any internal approvals required before accepting a quotation or placing an Order.
Failure to identify obvious discrepancies before acceptance may delay Order processing or require the issuance of revised commercial documentation.

M. Good Faith
Both parties shall act in good faith during quotation, pricing negotiations, and commercial discussions. Neither party shall knowingly provide false, misleading, or fraudulent information or engage in conduct intended to manipulate pricing or procurement processes.

N. Compliance with Applicable Law
Nothing contained in this Chapter shall:
• exclude, restrict, or limit any legal obligation imposed upon either party under applicable law;
• prevent the Company from correcting genuine pricing errors in accordance with applicable law;
• affect any binding pricing terms contained in an executed written agreement; or
• limit any rights or remedies that cannot lawfully be excluded by contract.
Where any provision of this Chapter conflicts with mandatory legal requirements, the applicable law shall prevail to the extent of such inconsistency.`

• technical specifications;
• commercial feasibility;
• payment arrangements;
• compliance with applicable laws;

Following acceptance, any changes requested by the Business Customer regarding quantities, delivery schedules, product specifications, or shipping locations shall require mutual written consent and may result in adjustments to pricing, delivery timelines, or ancillary fees. Fulfillment of Purchase Orders shall be carried out in accordance with agreed commercial terms, logistics procedures, and applicable laws.`
